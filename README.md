In this project i have made a todo application in Ruby on Rails.

Features of App:
1. Create a todo task.
2. Update the status of todo i.e completed or not. We can also mark complete more than one todo at a time.
3. Delete the todo. It can be done in three ways:
(a). Delete first todo.
(b). Delete second todo.
(c). Delete all todo.
